A frontend-only website that uses the technologies I have learned throughout the Interactive Frontend Development in my Code Institute course. 

The single page application relies on the Google Maps API, Google Autocomplete API and the Google Places API to allow users to search for their next city break destination.

The user begins by searching for a destination city (with help from the Google Autocomplete API). 

The user then decides if they would like to filter the results from the place types list, otherwise all types will be shown.

The project takes advantage of the materialize.css library to make components of the site visually appealing, as well as using Google fonts to display the title of the page.
